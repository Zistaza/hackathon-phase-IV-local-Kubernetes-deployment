# Implementation Plan: Professional Home Page UI/UX

**Branch**: `004-home-page-ui`
**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Spec**: /specs/004-home-page-ui/spec.md

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a professional, responsive homepage for the Todo web application with light/dark theme support, smooth animations, and clear call-to-action buttons. The homepage will feature a hero section, feature cards, and authentication CTAs following modern SaaS design principles. Built using Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for animations, with a focus on accessibility and performance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, JavaScript ES2022
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 16+, React 18+, Tailwind CSS 4.0+, Framer Motion 11+
**Storage**: LocalStorage for theme preference persistence, CSS variables for theme state
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library (future implementation)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with responsive design
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend only for homepage)
**Performance Goals**: 60fps animations, <3s initial load time, <100ms interaction response
**Constraints**: Must support light/dark themes, responsive design, accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
**Scale/Scope**: Single page application with 5-7 UI sections and interactive elements

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✓ **Separation of Concerns**: Homepage UI will be isolated in frontend layer without backend dependencies
✓ **Security by Default**: No authentication logic needed for public homepage
✓ **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Not applicable for public homepage
✓ **Deterministic APIs**: Not applicable for homepage (will be tested separately for API endpoints)
✓ **Cloud-Native Design**: Following Next.js best practices for stateless frontend
✓ **Technology Standards**: Using Next.js 16+, Tailwind CSS, and React as specified in constitution
✓ **REST API Contract**: Not applicable for homepage (will be implemented for API endpoints)

**Structure Decision**: Modifying existing Next.js App Router structure with enhanced homepage in page.tsx and supporting components in the components directory. Theme functionality already exists in globals.css and will be enhanced.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: UI Architecture & Theming Foundation

1. **Create Theme Context and Hook**
   - Implement ThemeContext for managing theme state
   - Create useTheme hook for accessing theme functionality
   - Set up localStorage persistence for theme preference
   - Implement system preference detection

2. **Enhance CSS Variables for Theming**
   - Extend globals.css with additional theme variables
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility
   - Add smooth transition properties for theme switching

3. **Create Reusable UI Components**
   - ThemeToggle component for switching between light/dark modes
   - AnimatedButton component with hover/click animations
   - Card component for feature cards with consistent styling

### Phase 2: Core Sections Implementation

1. **Hero Section Development**
   - Create animated Hero component with fade-in effect
   - Implement app name, tagline, and value proposition
   - Add primary CTA buttons ("Get Started", "Sign In") with animations

2. **Description/Value Section**
   - Create section explaining Todo app benefits
   - Optimize typography for readability in both themes
   - Implement subtle entrance animation

3. **Feature Cards Section**
   - Develop 4 feature cards (Task Management, Secure Login, Cloud Sync, Fast & Responsive)
   - Implement hover animations using Framer Motion
   - Ensure consistent design in both light and dark themes
   - Add icons or visual indicators for each feature

### Phase 3: CTA, Animations, and Interactions
